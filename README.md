<h1>HiðŸ‘‹</h1>

I like to make things and learn things. Mostly in JavaScript/TypeScript. Most of my projects can be found on my website.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various web applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and Angular
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Why would you want to do that?
- âš¡ Fun fact: Water is wet. Mindblowing, I know.

- Disclaimer: Some of the code here is pretty garbage, but I think it's worthwhile to show my progression. Thankfully I've improved significantly since I've started.
